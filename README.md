# Linear Regression-
understanding and predicting the Laptop prices based on features 

As I am mostly focusing on coding and the data science technique to understand data and get most of it using Liner models as per my knowledge and understanding in this notebook. I have skip the theory part for the Liner Regression and it functioning which you will get plenty of theoretical material on internet.
Following are the few articles which will help you to get basic understanding and theoretical concept about Liner Regression models
